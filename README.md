# Tetris The Grand Master: Ace - English Patch

Patch for TGM: Ace that was made in an afternoon by using Ghidra and wxMEdit.

The `docs/` folder contains the game's promotional Flash website that, I modified with JPEXS and Adobe Flash CS6, [check it out](https://sakimotor.github.io/tgma_eng/)

## Installation

Dump your game, find "default.xex" and apply the delta patch thanks to xdeltaGUI or Delta Patcher.


## Notes

As my Xbox 360 is a retail western console, I do not have the ability to play the game online. Therefore, all translations of the online features are untested.

Plus, **this patch only supports the 1.0 version of the game**, please reach out to me if you have a dump of the update (`Sakimotor#7923`)
